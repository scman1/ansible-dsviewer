Setting up a virtual machine 

Configure port forwarding for connecting from the host (local machine) 
to map a loopback port to the host broadcast address and port
eg:
host 127.0.0.1:2522 guest [address can be blank]:22

Install openssh server on the vm guest and make sute it is running

$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
$ ps -A | grep sshd

To create deploy user need to generate a key for login, run:

mkpasswd --method=sha-512

Use ssh-copy-id to install SSH key on servers as authorized keys for passwordless 
authentication.

pattern:
ssh-copy-id [-p port] [user@]machine

ssh-copy-id -p 2522 abraham@127.0.0.1 

Edit SSH config file to create a host alias to connect (~/.ssh/config). 
The entry should look something like:

Host deployvm
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    Port 2522
    User abraham
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentitiesOnly yes

At this point, the host alias can be used in the ansible hosts file  (inventory/hosts) 
and used when connecting to the host.
